What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

The assignment was helpful and fun. I learned how to make a git commit/
push the most recent version of my code to github. I also enjoyed
revisiting the DFA, having taken ECE 206 (where DFA was known as FSM).
It was also cool writing a program that performs a task of the 
preprocessor; I feel like I'm developing an understanding of the inner
mechanisms of computer systems.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I do not think there are any bugs in my submission. I tested a 
non-final-version once and it failed after passing in the file
04falsecommentstart7.txt. Then, I made changes and it passed the test
on the same file. The next day, when I ran this same version again on
the same file, it failed. I since made revisions, and the final 
version passed the test on this file. I tested my final code on this
file repeatedly and tested on all the files, including decomment.c
itself, and everything worked. I don't have an expalanation
for how that previous version passed the test but then failed the next
day for the same code, same test file. I'm thinking maybe I did not 
pass in the test file I thought I did. To account for a possible weird
thing happening to the code, I will clarify the change I made to obtain
the final version of my code that passed all tests: Placing an if()
conditional in the main() method, outside of the while loop:
if (state == MAYBE_COMMENT) {putchar('/');}. This passed when testing
on 04falsecommentstart7.txt.
